    <h2>✨ From Confused to Creating</h2>
    <p>
      I was that first-year student who didn’t know where anything was — or what
      was even going on. Fast forward a bit — I figured things out (kind of 😅),
      picked up some skills, and built this platform to help you enjoy your
      first year without missing the fun.

    <h2>Built to Grow With You</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in making the first-year experience smooth, fun, and full of
      exploration. This site is growing into a dynamic hub for sharing ideas,
      resources, and stories — and I’ll keep adding more features along the way.
